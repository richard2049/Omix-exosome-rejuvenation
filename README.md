# SRSC: Cross-species translational analysis of exosome interventions (exploratory v0.1)

> **Status:** exploratory / work in progress (v0.1-beta).  
> This repository is intended as a portfolio / research project in aging and translational bioinformatics.

## Overview

This project explores cross-species translational signals between mouse and primate
datasets in the context of exosome-based interventions. The pipeline integrates:

- mouse bulk RNA-seq (tissue-level effects),
- plasma proteomics,
- and primate methylation data (OMIX007582, Mammal40 array),

to derive exploratory translational insights about rejuvenation-like signatures.

The code is intentionally modular and experiment-focused rather than production-grade.

## Data

The project uses public datasets from OmicsDI / NGDC, including:

- **OMIX007580 / OMIX007581** (expression / proteomics)
- **OMIX007582** (Mammal40 methylation, IDAT format)

Raw data files (IDAT, full matrices, etc.) are **not** stored in this repository.
Only small illustrative examples (e.g. `data/processed/OMIX007582_beta_matrix_example.csv`)
are included to demonstrate the format.

## Methylation processing (OMIX007582, Mammal40)

The `scripts/process_OMIX007582_Mammal40.R` script uses
[SeSAMe](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sesame.html) and
`sesameData` to process Mammal40 IDAT files into a CpG × sample beta-value matrix.

**Important limitations:**

- The beta matrix contains **643 sample columns** (technical IDs).
- The accompanying metadata table `OMIX007582-02.csv` has **620 rows** (biological samples).
- No public mapping is provided that unambiguously links every IDAT file to its exact
  biological sample.

Consequently:

- `OMIX007582_beta_matrix.csv` is produced with **technical sample IDs** only and used
  for analyses that do not require exact one-to-one sample annotation.
- An **optional** partially named matrix (`OMIX007582_beta_matrix_named_partial.csv`)
  can be generated by assuming column order ≈ metadata row order for the first
  620 samples. This is clearly marked in the code as *exploratory-only* and is
  not used for strong sample-level conclusions.

## Pipeline

The main workflow is implemented in `src/run_pipeline.py` and includes:

- loading and harmonizing omics blocks (expression, proteomics, methylation),
- estimating exosome-attributable fractions,
- cross-tissue concordance analyses,
- optional translational insight generation when all required blocks are available.

When methylation sample IDs cannot be aligned to full metadata, the pipeline:

- falls back to minimal metadata (`sample_id` only),
- logs clear warnings,
- and skips analyses that would require fully matched annotation, instead of forcing
  an incorrect mapping.

## Reproducibility

A minimal `environment.yml` is provided with Python dependencies
(e.g. `pandas`, `numpy`, `scanpy`, etc.). Methylation processing depends on:

- R (`>=4.3`)
- Bioconductor packages `sesame`, `sesameData`, `BiocParallel`

See `scripts/process_OMIX007582_Mammal40.R` for details.

## Status and future work

This is a **v0.1 exploratory** implementation. Future directions include:

- obtaining or reconstructing a more reliable sample matching for OMIX007582,
- extending the translational module with additional mouse interventions,
- refactoring the pipeline into a more generalizable package.

Despite the limitations, this repository documents the end-to-end process of:

- integrating multi-omics public datasets,
- handling real-world metadata inconsistencies,
- and extracting exploratory translational hypotheses in the aging / longevity domain.
